## Project setup

Now that you have the code on your local machine, it's time to run the skeleton project. The first thing you'll need to do is to download any dependencies by running this command:
​
```
npm install
```
​
Start your Vue application with the following command:
​
```
npm run serve
```

You should now be able to open the app in your browser.

Next take a moment to review the `.env` file that's located in the root of the project. You can store environment variables that you want to use throughout your application in this file. When you open it, it'll look like this:
​
```
# Java
VUE_APP_REMOTE_API=https://bird-backend-d3a95583b08e.herokuapp.com
```

## Getting Started

When you first open the app you should notice that it isn't pretty, but it does contain some basic routing and authorization functionality. You should recognize this code from the final capstone starter code, but for more details, see the README.md file contained in the `vue` directory. 

**It's your task to construct a beautiful web client (front end) to make full use of the existing server.**

First, visit the [Swagger Documentation](https://tenmo-backend-d4e3122fe920.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/index.html) to see all available endpoints . 

Next, take a look at the wireframes (or create your own) and decide where you'd like to start. 

Now you are ready to start coding. *GLHF!*
